What I want? Narrows down to alot of few things. Being good. Good at what I do, my personality and generally at everything that drives me.

The best son, brother, friend, husband, father name it all, is my greatest desire. Like, I wake up every morning with all these dreams, targets and ambitions. Including **visions** of a better person.

A role model.
