**Friends**, well, it has been a mystery I have been trying to solve for quite a long time. Well why's that?
Honestly, no dictionary has given me the perfect illustration or definiton of that because eventually, I'm like humm.
Well, that kinda brings out my character. I have this admiringlibly charming charisma which attracts anyone easily.
