One sad thing about history <br></br>
Is that the memories keep flashing back quickly <br></br>
And then it drains you to your feet makes you a weakling <br></br>
And makes you wish that all the shit had never happened, Yeah <br></br>

OMG what I'm I doing, <br></br>
I'm so fucking damn tired if this feeling, <br></br>
Wish I could let go and let go the hurting, <br></br>
I've tried the pills to numb the pain but none is working <br></br>
I guess I'm just a sad wretch, sad boy Wrecked <br></br>
I guess this is my worst heartbreak <br></br>
