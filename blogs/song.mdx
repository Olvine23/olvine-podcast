One sad thing about history 

Is that the memories keep flashing back quickly 

And then it drains you to your feet makes you a weakling

And makes you wish that all the shit had never happened, Yeah

OMG what I'm I doing,

I'm so fucking damn tired if this feeling,

Wish I could let go and let go the hurting,

I've tried the pills to numb the pain but none is working

I guess I'm just a sad wretch, sad boy Wrecked

I guess this is my worst heartbreak
